    3 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: improve version message, gracefully exiting

    4 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: better manage error display + mastering program exit code

    5 2022- 1-29 coreLogger: manage colors

    7 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: only the first subcommand is considered, followings are ignored
                 while they should trigger an error (most probably is from commander origin)

    8 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: eat considered subcommand, leaving others in remaining
                 + check remaining is empty

   19 2022- 2- 1 be able to change the log level of a server at runtime, distinguishing every server

   22 2022- 2- 2 command iz.start.broker / iz.stop.broker

   23 2022- 2- 2 command iz.start.managed / iz.stop.managed

   31 2022- 2- 6 when counting services implied by a controller (on start, stop, etc),
                  check that there is no loop (a subcontroller does not try to start a top controller of the hierarchy)

   33 2022- 2- 6 make sure the controller/subcontrolller hierarchy is one level max (ie. FLAT)

   35 2022- 2- 6 coreRunfile: use mv/rename to get an atomic lock

   37 2022- 2- 7 IZTIAR_DEBUG="" bin/iztiar start -l test debug

    6 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: config/plugins/storageDirs defaults are hardcoded in global.js
                 should be overridable in environment before being eventually overiden that the command-line
      2022- 2- 1 useless: the command-line option is enough -> closed

    9 2022- 1-30 forked process should log to a file or to journalctl
      2022- 2- 1 seems that only info level is logged ?
      2022- 2- 1 level issue is fixed - close the issue

   10 2022- 1-30 main cli process should wait for controller advertising (if any) before quitting
      2022- 1-30 done

   11 2022- 1-30 mastering main cli exit code
      2022- 2- 1 at the moment, only cliStart() set the return code of the process
      2022- 2- 8 done via Iztiar.exitCode()

   12 2022- 1-30 refuse to start a controller with an already running name
      2022- 2- 8 done

   13 2022- 2- 1 broker status is not displayed when asking for 'iztiar status'
      2022- 2- 1 fixed (had to run a mqtt server + a tcp server, each on their own port)

   14 2022- 2- 1 cliStop(): stop the running servers
                 stop the child processes, first by a 'iz.stop' command, then by killing pid's
                 do not forgive to unlinking run/ json files
      2022- 2- 1 done

   15 2022- 2- 1 when requesting for 'iz.status', have a timeout if the server doesn't answer
                 rather handle ECONNREFUSED exception
      2022- 2- 8 seems to be out of the box and a feature already available

   16 2022- 2- 1 test for starting a second controller managed by a first one
                 handle the case where the first one is not present or not capable
      2022- 2- 9 done with same as in README.Controller

   17 2022- 2- 1 utils.makeFnameDirExists() should call a utils.makeDirExists() to be written
      2022- 2- 1 done

   18 2022- 2- 1 write a line on server log when the child quits
      2022- 2- 1 done

   20 2022- 2- 1 throw exception rather than returning a coreError (so throw a coreError exception)
                 as this is more efficient and easier to manage
      2022- 2- 3 done

   24 2022- 2- 2 command iz.set.loglevel
      20226 2- 9 cancelled as duplicate of #19

   25 2022- 2- 4 review logger : doe all should go to the log ? and the loglevel only applying to the console
      2022- 2- 8 logger goes to file with logLevel. Dot.
                 console is only concerned about by verbose mode

   26 2022- 2- 4 review runtime configuration to have a main controller and managed controllers
      2022- 2- 8 implemented - to be validated - see also #16
      2022- 2- 9 done

   27 2022- 2- 4 review coreRuntime to not read json file each time
      2022- 2- 8 cancelled as we have to be sure we work with the very last version

   28 2022- 2- 4 have a forked status in two phases: the pid is it alive, the process does it answer
      2022- 2- 8 implemented this way in coreForkable.CheckService()

   29 2022- 2- 6 when reading a controller configuration, check that we have managed *or* manager
      2022- 2- 9 done

   30 2022- 2- 6 when counting services implied by a controller (on start, stop, etc),
                  check for a potential broker in each subcontroller
      2022- 2- 9 done

   34 2022- 2- 6 coreCmdline: have a log.info line 'process invoked wth parameters'
      2022- 2- 9 done

   36 2022- 2- 6 start: have an option force-clear to reset the state of stalled runfiles
                 status: have an option remove to remove the stalled services from runfiles
                 or have a clear command to behave like this ?
      2022- 2- 8 use --force-stop when stopping a service makes sure the environment is left clean

   38 2022- 2- 7 a controller cannot be named 'ALL' - and this must be checked
                  in cliStart() + in checkStatus() + in cliStop()
      2022- 2- 8 checkServiceWithJson() done => cliStatus() done
      2022- 2- 8 cliStart() updated accordingly

   39 2022- 2- 7 checkStatus() must have a coreController
      2022- 2- 8 done

      2022- 2- 9 done

   42 2022- 2- 7 have a list of said running services command
      2022- 2- 9 done with list-runnings action
