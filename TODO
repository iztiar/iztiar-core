    4 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: better manage error display + mastering program exit code

    5 2022- 1-29 coreLogger: manage colors

    7 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: only the first subcommand is considered, followings are ignored
                 while they should trigger an error (most probably is from commander origin)

    8 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: eat considered subcommand, leaving others in remaining
                 + check remaining is empty

   11 2022- 1-30 mastering main cli exit code
      2022- 2- 1 at the moment, only cliStart() set the return code of the process

   12 2022- 1-30 refuse to start a controller with an already running name

   15 2022- 2- 1 when requesting for 'iz.status', have a timeout if the server doesn't answer
                 rather handle ECONNREFUSED exception

   16 2022- 2- 1 test for starting a second controller managed by a first one
                 handle the case where the first one is not present or not capable

   19 2022- 2- 1 be able to change the log level of a server at runtime, distinguishing every server

   20 2022- 2- 1 throw exception rather than returning a coreResult (so throw a coreResult exception)
                 as this is more efficient and easier to manage

   21 2022- 2- 1 be able to log to journalctl, via a command-line and/or configuration option

   22

    6 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: config/plugins/storageDirs defaults are hardcoded in global.js
                 should be overridable in environment before being eventually overiden that the command-line
      2022- 2- 1 useless: the command-line option is enough -> closed
