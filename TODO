    1 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: accept that long options be abbreviated

    2 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: improve help message, gracefully exiting

    3 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: improve version message, gracefully exiting
                 e.g. displaying a copyright message
                 e.g. displaying some more verbose message

    4 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: better manage error display + mastering program exit code

    5 2022- 1-29 coreLogger: manage colors

    7 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: only the first subcommand is considered, followings are ignored
                 while they should trigger an error (most probably is from commander origin)

    8 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: eat considered subcommand, leaving others in remaining
                 + check remaining is empty

   11 2022- 1-30 mastering main cli exit code
      2022- 2- 1 at the moment, only cliStart() set the return code of the process

   12 2022- 1-30 refuse to start a controller with an already running name

   15 2022- 2- 1 when requesting for 'iz.status', have a timeout if the server doesn't answer
                 rather handle ECONNREFUSED exception

   16 2022- 2- 1 test for starting a second controller managed by a first one
                 handle the case where the first one is not present or not capable

   19 2022- 2- 1 be able to change the log level of a server at runtime, distinguishing every server

   21 2022- 2- 1 be able to log to journalctl, via a command-line and/or configuration option

   22 2022- 2- 2 command iz.start.broker / iz.stop.broker

   23 2022- 2- 2 command iz.start.managed / iz.stop.managed

   24 2022- 2- 2 command iz.set.loglevel

   25 2022- 2- 4 review logger : doe all should go to the log ? and the loglevel only applying to the console

   26 2022- 2- 4 review runtime configuration to have a main controller and manager controllers

   27 2022- 2- 4 review coreRuntime to not read json file each time

   28 2022- 2- 4 have a forked status in two phases: the pid is it alive, the process does it answer

   29 2022- 2- 6 when reading a controller configuration, check that we have managed *or* manager

   30 2022- 2- 6 when counting services implied by a controller (on start, stop, etc),
                  check for a potential broker in each subcontroller

   31 2022- 2- 6 when counting services implied by a controller (on start, stop, etc),
                  check that there is no loop (a subcontroller does not try to start a top controller of the hierarchy)

   33 2022- 2- 6 make sure the controller/subcontrolller hierarchy is one level max (ie. FLAT)

   34 2022- 2- 6 coreCmdline: have a log.info line 'process invoked wth parameters'

   35 2022- 2- 6 coreRunfile: use mv/rename to get an atomic lock

   36 2022- 2- 6 start: have an option force-clear to reset the state of stalled runfiles
                 status: have an option remove to remove the stalled services from runfiles
                 or have a clear command to behave like this ?

   37 2022- 2- 7 IZTIAR_DEBUG="" bin/iztiar start -l test debug
                 Cmdline bug ? unable to get the servicename just rifght after parse

   38 2022- 2- 7 a controller cannot be named 'ALL' - and this must be checked
                  in cliStart() + in checkStatus() + in cliStop()
      2022- 2- 8 checkServiceWithJson() done => cliStatus() done

   41 2022- 2- 7 cliStart(): the broker should only be forked when the controller has confirmed its startup
                 e.g. in startupOnIPCMessage()

   42 2022- 2- 7 have a list of said running services command

    6 2022- 1-29 coreCmdline: config/plugins/storageDirs defaults are hardcoded in global.js
                 should be overridable in environment before being eventually overiden that the command-line
      2022- 2- 1 useless: the command-line option is enough -> closed

    9 2022- 1-30 forked process should log to a file or to journalctl
      2022- 2- 1 seems that only info level is logged ?

   14 2022- 2- 1 cliStop(): stop the running servers
                 stop the child processes, first by a 'iz.stop' command, then by killing pid's
                 do not forgive to unlinking run/ json files

                 as this is more efficient and easier to manage
      2022- 2- 3 done
