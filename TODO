    1 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: accept that long options be abbreviated

    2 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: improve help message, gracefully exiting
                 e.g. displaying a copyright message

    3 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: improve version message, gracefully exiting
                 e.g. displaying a copyright message
                 e.g. displaying some more verbose message

    4 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: better manage error display + mastering program exit code

    7 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: only the first subcommand is considered, followings are ignored
                 while they should trigger an error (most probably is from commander origin)

    8 2022- 1-29 ICmdLine: eat considered subcommand, leaving others in remaining
                 + check remaining is empty

   19 2022- 2- 1 be able to change the log level of a server at runtime, distinguishing every server
      2022- 2- 9 e.g. with verb iz.set.loglevel

   21 2022- 2- 1 be able to log to journalctl, via a command-line and/or configuration option

   37 2022- 2- 7 IZTIAR_DEBUG="" bin/iztiar start -l test debug
                 Cmdline bug ? unable to get the servicename just right after parse

   46 2022- 2- 9 when stopping, have an option to stop all runnings

   47 2022- 2- 9 when starting, have an option to start all enabled

   52 2022- 3-16 core should specify which node version it is compatible with
      2022- 3-17 this is done, but ignored at the moment
                 so this item becomes : check the engines/node minimal version specify

   53 2022- 3-16 plugin should specify which core version they are compatible with
      2022- 3-18 this is planned in the package.json.md documentation - to be honored

   54 2022- 3-17 honor --no-daemon option

   55 2022- 3-17 coreBroker is a plugin which provides an independant forkable feature
                  now writes a plugin which provides a new interface
      2022- 3-23 pidUsage is an add-on for a running feature

   56 2022- 3-17 have IStart interface on the IStatus model

   57 2022- 3-17 have IStop interface on the IStatus model

   58 2022- 3-17 review iztiar-group.schema.json to better describes the byFeature and byCapability datas

   60 2022- 3-18 reorganize src/ sources to classes/ and interfaces/ subdirectories, due to the growing count of files

   61 2022- 3-18 use rotatelogs + limit the size of the logs
      2022- 4- 2 a logrotate configuration file is used and works fine, but has the drawback of requiring uid=0 owner

   62 2022- 3-18 use lowdb to manage run files

   64 2022- 3-21 review status functions chaining: ifeatureprovider is not called

   67 2022- 3-22 engineApi.config.filled is equal to engineApi.config.json

   68 2022- 3-23 rename featureCard.iProvider() to something better

   70 2022- 3-23 a feature works in its own instance, while an add-on works in its hosting instance
                  maybe this could be materialized by a different interface or derived classes

   71 2022- 3-23 write engine-api.schema.md

   74 2022- 3-27 update election algorythm to allow a controller to force its own election when it starts up

   78 2022- 4- 1 cliStart, cliStop and cliStatus: greetingsMessage should be a level up to normal (info?)

   80 2022- 4- 1 split the application configuration name by feature ?

   81 2022- 4- 2 ITcpServer interface: should have a wildcard function when adding commands so that the
                  implementation is able to see all what is not pre-planned

   83 2022- 4- 3 IFeatureProvider.v_killed() should be renamed postStop()

   84 2022- 4- 3 As a consequence of #83, also have preStart, postStart, preStop ?

   85 2022- 4- 4 masterController should be published as retained message
                  and election algorithm updated accordingly

   86 2022- 4- 4 rootCA should be moved from broker to core configuration

   87 2022- 4- 4 fix connectPeriod vs reconnectPeriod in IMqttClient configuration

      2022- 2- 1 useless: the command-line option is enough -> closed

    9 2022- 1-30 forked process should log to a file or to journalctl

   31 2022- 2- 6 when counting services implied by a controller (on start, stop, etc),

                 or have a clear command to behave like this ?
      2022- 2- 8 use --force-stop when stopping a service makes sure the environment is left clean

   38 2022- 2- 7 a controller cannot be named 'ALL' - and this must be checked

      2022- 2- 8 checkServiceWithJson() done => cliStatus() done
      2022- 2- 8 cliStart() updated accordingly

      2022- 2-10 done

   45 2022- 2- 9 on checkService() have an option to be quiet, only errors, normal, verbose
                  verbose implies pidUsage
      2022- 2-10 Cmdline bug: the first '-v' option doesn't trigger the parseVerbosity() function
      2022- 3-16 obsoleted as of core v0.5.0

   48 2022- 2-10 replace Iztiar.exitCode() with process.exitCode

   50 2022- 2-10 cliStop() open a tcp server in order to be able to receive messages from terminating processes

      2022- 2-11 done

   51 2022- 2-11 coreBroker should be just a plugin
      2022- 3-16 done as of v0.4.0

      2022- 3-24 no: depending of the client, we may wait for an answer

   72 2022- 3-23 seen on pidUsage add-on: seems that all three configurations are not filled the same way
                  to be checked
      2022- 3-23 this is normal as only the loaded feature need to get its add-ons filled

   73 2022- 3-24 be consistant among interfaces for implementation api naming
                  almost everywhere, the '_' prefix is for private function
                  find another prefix for there almost-virtual methods
      2022- 3-24 done with v_xxx methods

   75 2022- 4- 1 upgrade IMqttClient to be able to manage several broker connections
      2022- 3- 3 done

   76 2022- 4- 1 IMqttClient should only requires cert when the broker tells so, ie let other authentification ways to be used
                 or nothing at all
      2022- 4- 3 cert/key is no more mandatory, used when here

   77 2022- 4- 1 IMqttClient.advertise() in debug mode: do not publish security items (cert, key, username, password)
      2022- 4- 3 possible through _securedConf()

   79 2022- 4- 1 IMqttClient: do not always install 'alive' publication as the broker we connect to may be an external one
                  implies: be able to identify a Iztiar broker, willing to accept alive pubs
      2022- 4- 3 done

   82 2022- 4- 2 IMqttClient.advertise() should be connect()
