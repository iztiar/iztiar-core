Note: at the moment, this a rather a tool specification than an actual tool description.

### Installing ###

Install this piece of gold that Iztiar aims to be is as simple as just running one command in the console:

```bash
wget -O- https://www.github.com/iztiar/install/install.sh | sudo bash
```

You can also download and examine it to know exactly what it does. In brief:

- check your systems for prerequisites
- request from the console the configuration informations if they have not been provided in the command-line
- before doing anything, display a summary of what the script will do, requesting for a confirmation of a cancellation
- last, does the work hoping you have confirmed the stuff.

The installer should focalize on installing all services on a single host. Spanning the environment on several hosts should be considered as an advanced alternative.
