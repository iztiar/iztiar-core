## Technologies

### Development language

Our first technical strategy and decision is to build a full (i.e. both client-side and server-side) javascript software.

More, developing with javascript language lead us to try to take advantage of it and target a full ESM (EcmaScript modules) architecture.

So Node.js (which is one of the prerequisites) minimal version must be 12 LTS for its ESM support.

### User interface framework

Our second technical strategy and decision is to use [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) to handle the user interface. This decision is obviously at least in a part driven by the first decision above.

As a consequence, the database will be a mongodb instance.

### Messaging

The software relies on a messaging bus, which is MQTT-driven.

### Security

From our point of view, the security of any information system depends of three main aspects:

- integrity : one must be sure that the information it receives is exactly what has been sent
- confidentiality : one must be sure that the information sent to a target is only readable by this target
- non-repudiation: one must be sure that the emitter of a received information cannot say that it never sends it.

We have chosen to implement these three points at the very core of the architecture through a certificate-based point-to-point communication system.

In other words, all the security relies on a predefined configuration, where a trustee administrator configures each point-to-point communication channel by defining who is authorized to communicate which who.

Then there are two points :

    - coreController's do not communicate between them
    - only communications at the moment are those between a IMqttClient and a IMqttServer.

Iztiar primary installation generate a CA root certificate available for the full environment (e.g. production), called here 'environment-based-CA-root' or also EBCAR (what a pretty name isn'it !?).

Then each IMqttClient and each IMqttServer must also have their own environment-base-client-certificate, called here EBCC.

It is so only a matter of configuring the server to only allow this and this client by specifying the public key in its configuration.
