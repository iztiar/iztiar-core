README.architecture
    A high-level survey of the architecture.

    Environment
        We are talking of the development vs. staging vs. production, etc.
        From the core application point of vieuw, you can have as many environments as you want on a same host,
        though each plugin may exhibit some specificity which might prevent this.
        The environment is materialized by its storage directory.
