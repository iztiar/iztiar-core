Controller
    What is it
        A coreController is thought to manage other daemons, the WebUI being only one particular of these.
        Several coreController's may collaborate together, provided that all collaborating controllers be in the same host.

        In other words, a very big architecture may be:

            - the main host of the application because it hosts the main database
                offers probably also WEB UI service
                has one main coreController
                has maybe one coreBroker which offers messaging service
                may have zero to several managed coreControllers
                    e.g. one managed controller by protocol gateway
            
            - zero to several other hosts
                each one having one main coreController, itself being managed by the main coreController from the main host
                each one having most probably one coreBroker
                each one have zero to several (locally) managed coreControllers.

    Management
        The coreController is identified by a name
            freely chosen by the user
            which must be unique on the host (and that we suggest to make unique in the whole architecture)
            Whether the coreController is the main one on the host, or a managed one is chosen at startup time:
            to start a managed coreController, you have to say at startup by which coreController it is managed by.

        Note:
            Though it must be only one main coreController on the host, this sentence must be understood for a given
            running environment (development, production, etc.).
            See README.Architecture for a word about environments.

        Say you have several controllers on a same host:
        - you can start them individually from the command-line
        - but you'd better take advantage of a configuration file and let Iztiar starts them all together.

        When a coreController is stopped from the command-line, all the servers it has started itself
        are automatically stopped together.
        When the main coreController happens to be stopped this way, one the managed controllers, if any, which
        will be kept alive after the operation, is automatically designated as the new main coreController.
