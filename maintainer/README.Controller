Controller
    is the main daemon which manages all other (things?)
    controller is responsible for starting a dedicated local-to-the-host mqtt broker (here aedes)
    the default behavior is to start this broker

    is there several controllers on a host ?
        why not
        are identified by a user-provided name
            which eventually resolves to a systemd-service name

    when starting a controller, we says to it that it has to connect to a parent controller
        on the same host -> so a child connects to a parent
        on another host ?
            why not

    are several controllers meants to work together ?
        this would be fine but shouldn't be mandatory

    there may be many (at least several)
    there are identified
        locally by a user-provided name
        remotely by the host+local_identifier

    eventually there is a main controller which knows about all others

    ***
    *** There should be one and only one message bus per host and per environment (production, development, staging, etc.)
    *** As a consequence, the controller which manages this message bus is said the main controller of this host
    *** and all management commands received by other controllers on this host have to be forwarded to this main controller
    ***
