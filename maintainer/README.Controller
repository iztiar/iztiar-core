Controller
    What is it

        In other words, a very big architecture may be:

            - the main host of the application because it hosts the main database
                offers probably also WEB UI service
                has one main coreController
                has maybe one coreBroker which offers messaging service
                may have zero to several managed coreControllers
                    e.g. one managed controller by protocol gateway
            
            - zero to several other hosts
                each one having one main coreController, itself being managed by the main coreController from the main host
                each one having most probably one coreBroker
                each one have zero to several (locally) managed coreControllers.

    Management
            Whether the coreController is the main one on the host, or a managed one is chosen at startup time:
            to start a managed coreController, you have to say at startup by which coreController it is managed by.

        Note:
            Though it must be only one main coreController on the host, this sentence must be understood for a given
            running environment (development, production, etc.).
            See README.Architecture for a word about environments.

        Say you have several controllers on a same host:
        - you can start them individually from the command-line
        - but you'd better take advantage of a configuration file and let Iztiar starts them all together.

        When a coreController is stopped from the command-line, all the servers it has started itself
        are automatically stopped together.
        When the main coreController happens to be stopped this way, one the managed controllers, if any, which
        will be kept alive after the operation, is automatically designated as the new main coreController.
